Moving Bars
===========

Illustrates the standard Knuth shuffle algorithm.

This is partly a proof of concept for potential sorting algorithms visualizations
and partly a mere artifact of my Unity learning process. As such, it is a mess,
but it illustrates some Unity coding ideas that might be useful in general. In
particular, almost everything is done from scripts. The scene contains nothing
but a camera with a script attached to it.
